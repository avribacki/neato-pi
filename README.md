# Neato Pi

The goal of this project is to allow a Neato XV robot to be used as a research platform.

It provides two modules:
- `neato` used to control the robot, access the laser and perfom odometry.
- `picam` used to access the Raspberry Pi Camera.

Each module can be used independently, either as a local library or through provided RPC server and client.
